# ISP-domains-filtering
This is the GitHub repository for my Thesis Project regarding the investigation of the parental control filtering mechanisms of the main Italin ISPs. The project examines how different ISPs filter domains, how effective parental controls are, and possible bypassing techniques. It is organized as follow:

## Code

Folder containing the python code used for the tests and for the analysis as well as the datasets used

## Compare_pc_nopc

Measurements results for parental control ON vs. OFF 

## Categories_analysis

Classification of accessible domains based on their category

## Bypassing_Techniques
